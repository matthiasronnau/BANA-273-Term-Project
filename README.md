### Data
The data for this project was acquired from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). This websits has over 500 datasets available to use for machine learning projects and research. 

The data is on attributes of different Mashable articles from a two year period, and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity#).

### Required Packages
The Python packages NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn were all used for analysis. NumPy and pandas were utilized for reading in the data, numerical analysis, and aggregation measures. Matplotlib and seaborn were utilized to create exploratory graphs as well as visuzlize elbow plots when implementing K-Nearest Neighbors. Finally, scikit-learn was used to develop, train, and assess the various models that we used.
